# GAE React Flux Todos


A simple Todos app in React and Flux, build on Google App Engine.

## Usage

To download and install, do the following:

    git clone git@github.com:bengrunfeld/gae-react-flux-todos.git
    cd gae-react-flux-todos
    npm install
    grunt

* Set up the Google App Engine Python development server

* Add the project. Click File -> Add Existing Application, then choose the app directory

* Navigate to `http://localhost:<port_number>`

* For `port_number`, I set it up in Google App Engine to use `8080`.

* NOTE: If you are on a different port number, you need to change this number in `src/js/contstants/app-constants.js`
